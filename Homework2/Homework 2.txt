        Two of the biggest things I took from the Last Lecture video was the brick wall and how to take criticism. Something I’ve always wanted to do is have a successful music career with a band. After discovering what it’s like to have to be found online I kind of just lost hope, because nobody ever gets as famous as Black Sabbath without luck. It wasn’t until I played in a jazz ensemble that I learned that playing with a band isn’t about getting famous but about just having fun playing music on stage and with other people. I feel like instead of crashing through the brick wall I instead just went around it. This is because now I believe that a successful career in music isn’t being rich & famous but about making other people happy and emotional; and if I keep doing what I’m doing now in a folk band I think I’ll stay happy and maybe even get some traction out of it.


        As for the criticism side part of the last lecture, I really felt when he said something along the lines of “If they still criticize you, it means that they still care for you.”. This is really important to me because I wasn’t really criticized much in my earlier years and my family in Billings would speak about how me and my siblings were such good kids. Then when criticism would appear, I saw it as a negative thing for quite a while but as I matured I realized that criticism is meant to help people grow. I related to this so much because there’s someone in my life in their 60s and they still can’t take criticism and they’re kind of not in a great place in life. Even just pondering on this subject now I realize I need to stop worrying about how people will take my criticism and just say what needs to be said to help them grow and realize if they are being inconsiderate or lazy.
