        I do think there’s a little bit of truth to learning styles, but it kind of feels like horoscopes to me. By that I mean it feels like it’s just a vague description of how people are anyways and that it’s nothing special. Also I feel like the quiz I took wasn’t really accurate. I’ve always been better at seeing something and then doing it right afterwards rather than just through hearing someone. Like with getting to know Missoula’s roads I just had to use maps for about a week and driving with my sister and know I have my route memorized.
