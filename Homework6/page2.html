        A theatrically-minded pet chameleon becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert after his vivarium accidentally falls out of his owners' car. Now left to fend for himself, he learns from the cause of the accident, armadillo hermit Roadkill who is seeking a mystical being known as the "Spirit of the West", about an American frontier-like town known by its animalistic populace as Dirt. Out of options, the chameleon sets out to find the town; after a near-fatal encounter with a vicious red-tailed hawk, he meets desert iguana rancher Beans, who takes him to Dirt.

Asked about his identity, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named "Rango". He quickly runs afoul of outlaw Bad Bill, who challenges him to a duel. The hawk interrupts it and chases Rango, who accidentally knocks over an empty water tower that crushes the predator to death. Believing he did so intentionally, the townsfolk praise Rango and he is appointed as the new sheriff by the town's elderly tortoise mayor. Some townsfolk worry that, with the hawk vanquished, infamous gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake will return.

As the town is suffering from a severe drought, Beans demands that Rango investigate the lack of water; in doing so, he inadvertently assists a mole bandit named Balthazar, whom he mistakes for a prospector, to steal the town's remaining water supply. Rango organizes a posse that finds banker Johannes Merrimack III dead in the middle of the desert, having drowned. The posse tracks Balthazar to his hideout, where they fight his bat-riding clan over the stolen water's water dispenser bottle storage before discovering it to be empty. Despite professing that they found it that way, Balthazar and his prairie dog sons, Jedidiah and Ezekiel, are taken into custody.

Realizing something suspicious is going on, Rango begins to question the mayor about how much land he has been buying around town lately to have a modern city constructed upon. Now revealed to be responsible for Merrimack's death, the mayor summons Rattlesnake Jake to expose Rango's lies and run him out of town. Dejected, Rango returns to where he was separated from his owners, crossing the highway amidst the heavy traffic and passing out on the opposite side. The next morning, he encounters the Spirit of the West, appearing as an elderly Man with No Name, who advises him to go back to Dirt and set things right, asserting that "no man can walk out on his own story".

With the aid of Roadkill and some mystical moving yuccas, Rango discovers an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline at Las Vegas which the mayor has been manipulating to cause the water shortage for his scandal. Rango returns to Dirt and challenges Jake to a duel, distracting him long enough for his allies, which include Balthazar's clan, to allow the water's restoration. Rango appears to have the upper hand, until the mayor forces him to surrender by threatening Beans' life as the duo are soon detained in the bank's flooding vault to be drowned.

The mayor then attempts to kill Jake with Rango's gun, believing the duo represent too much of Dirt's former lifestyles. However, Rango had beforehand taken out its only bullet and uses it to shatter the vault's glass door, freeing himself and Beans. Impressed, Jake praises Rango for proving himself before dragging the mayor off into the desert to murder him as retribution for his betrayal. Dirt's populace then celebrates the returns of their water supply and Rango, now a true hero.
